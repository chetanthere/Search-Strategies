Uninformed Search Strategies
For this assignment you will implement at least 2 of the uninformed search strategies learnt in class:

Breadth First Search
Depth First Search
additionally, you may want to try other techniques such as:

Unoform-cost Search
Depth-limited Search
Iterative Deepening Depth-first Search
Bidirectional Search
In your implementation consider the “GRAPH-SEARCH” algorithm in order to make a more intelligent exploration of the search space.

The input to your program will be that of the agent problem in Romania (from the AI textbook, figure 3.2: A simplified road map of part of Romania.) in a text format as the following:

Arad,Zerind,75
Arad,Timisoara,118
Arad,Sibiu,140
Zerind,Oradea,71
Oradea,Sibiu,151
Timisoara,Lugoj,111
Lugoj,Mehadia,70
Mehadia,Drobeta,75
Drobeta,Craiova,120
Craiova,Rimnicu Vilcea,146
Craiova,Pitesti,138
Sibiu,Fagaras,99
Sibiu,Rimnicu Vilcea,80
Rimnicu Vilcea,Pitesti,97
Fagaras,Bucharest,211
Pitesti,Bucharest,101
Bucharest,Urziceni,85
Bucharest,Giurgiu,90
Urziceni,Vaslui,142
Vaslui,Iasi,92
Iasi,Neamt,87
Urziceni,Hirsova,98
Hirsova,Eforie,86
Note that, for example, we only stored the path from Arad to Zerind with a path cost of 75 but we also have the path from Zerind to Arad with the same cost of 75 available.

Some of the functions that you need to implement are:

Graph-Search
InitializeFrontier
ChooseNode, make it a general function so that you are able to change the search strategy as easy as possible
TestGoal
ExpandNode
UpdateFrontier
For your data structure consider a node with the following information

node.STATE
node.PARENT
node.ACTION
node.PATH-COST
